# Design Patterns

Whenever we talk about Design it contributes to two things

1) Design Principles

2) Design Patterns

Design pattern is used to make application

1) Reliable

2) Scalable

3) Maintainable

**`Design Patterns :`** Design level solution for recurring problems that we software engineers come across often.

- It is like a discription on how to tackle these problems and design a solution.

- Design Patterns are reuseable solutions to the problems that we encounter in day to day programming.

- Design Pattern act as a template which can be applied to real world programming problem.

## History and Evalution of Design Pattern

- Book : Elements of reuseable object oriented software

- This book is written by 4 authors and they together are known as GOF(Gang of Four).
    - Gamma
    - Helm
    - Jhonson
    - Vlissides

- These people brought the concept of design pattern in the above book.

- In object oriented programming the center player is `Object`

- If we talk about `Object` we can perform 3 things on object
    
    1) We can `create` the object
    
    2) We can see the `behaviour` of the object
    
    3) We can also see how this object goes along with other object `Structure`

- Types of design Patterns : It is based on what all things we can do with object.

# Creational Design Pattern

- These patterns are designed for class instantitaion.

- They can be either class-creational patterns or object-creational patterns

- It gives the program more flexiblity in deciding which object needs to be created for a given case.

    ### Types of Creational Design Pattern : 

    1) Singleton Design Pattern  

    2) Factory Design Pattern  

    3) Factory Method Design Pattern

    4) Abstract Factory Design Pattern

    5) Builder Pattern

    6) Prototype Pattern

    7) Object Pool Pattern


# Structural Design Pattern

- These design patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition.

- Major focus area
    
    - Decoupling Interfaces

    - Implementation of classes and It's object

- The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of classes without changing much of it's composition.

    ### Types of Structural Design Pattern : 

    1) Adaptor Pattern 

    2) Bridge Pattern

    3) Composite Pattern 

    4) Decorator Pattern

    5) Facade Pattern 

    6) Fly weight Pattern

    7) Proxy Pattern

# Behavioural Design Pattern

- These patterns are designed depending upon how one class communicate between others and between classes and objects.

    ### Types of Behavioural Design Pattern : 

    1) Command Pattern

    2) Interpreter Pattern

    3) Iterator Pattern

    4) Mediator Pattern

    5) Memento Pattern

    6) Observer Pattern (Commonly Asked)

    7) State Pattern

    8) Strategy Pattern

    9) Template Pattern

    10) Visitor Pattern

    11) Chain of responsiblity Pattern

    12) Null Object Pattern
